## â˜• Using Change_image_color

To use Change_image_color, follow these steps:

1. Download the code with the name `alterarcor.py`.
2. Install the required Python libraries used in the code (Pillow and Tkinter).
3. Execute the code; it will open a Tkinter window.
4. In this window, there are range values to search for pixels at the bottom using a slider.
5. Use the "Open file" button to select the image you want to change.
6. With the image open, apply the filters and change the color as desired.
7. Using the "Change" button, you can change the order of RGB, making the colors swap places or invert.
8. Using the "Add" button, you can add and subtract pixel values in the image, modifying its color.
9. After applying the filters, select the "Apply color" button to modify the image.
10. With the modified image, use "Save Image" to save the image.
11. In the case of RGBA, if you want to modify the alpha channel, "Add to channel A" serves this purpose.
